<h3>A few of my projects</h3>

<a href='http://kickstarterclone.herokuapp.com'>Kickstarter Clone: </a>
<p>A clone of the website Kickstarter.  Main challenge was to enable the 
Project Creation form to be able to also create multiple reward levels and relate them back to the Project being created,
all while not saving anything to the database until the Create Project button is pushed, at which point all of them are saved to the
database simultaneously.  Still in progress.<a href='https://github.com/Madmat418/kickstarterclone'>See the code on Github<a></p>

<a href='https://github.com/Madmat418/Portfolio'>This site:</a>

I imported a template called Parallax606 with Bootstrap, which is the only portion of this site which was not programmed by myself.</p>
